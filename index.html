      <p>I was born and raised in Vietnam before moving to the US with my family.</p></h1>
      
      <p class="scrambled-text">Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by computers and technology, particularly computer video games. However, my parents held a negative view of computers, believing that video games were a waste of time. They wanted me to follow in their footsteps and become an architect.</p>
      <p>In Vietnamese culture, it is important for children to obey their parent's wishes. As a result, I was instructed to learn to draw, design, and manage building materials, among other things related to construction. While I enjoyed these tasks, my passion for computers never faded. I often snuck away to internet cafes to play video games with my friends, despite my parent's disapproval.</p>
      <p>Now that I am an adult, I am free to live my life and pursue my passions without needing to adhere to my parent's expectations. However, with freedom comes responsibility, and I must now support myself financially since I am no longer under my parent's protection.</p>
      <p>For a while, I struggled to afford daily living expenses in the US, as the cost of living is quite high here. Fortunately, after spending some time in the US, my parents became more open-minded and changed their views on computers. They now fully support my decision to pursue my passion and even sponsor me to do so.</p>
